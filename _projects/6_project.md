### What’s This About?  

Airborne sound control is essential for **mitigating noise pollution** and **enhancing acoustic comfort** in both public and private spaces. Traditional noise-control techniques, such as **absorptive materials and active noise cancellation**, often suffer from **limited bandwidth and efficiency constraints**.  

Recent advancements in **acoustic metasurfaces** provide a **physics-driven approach** by leveraging **engineered, subwavelength structures** to precisely **manipulate sound waves**. Our research focuses on developing **tunable acoustic metasurfaces** capable of **redirecting, absorbing, and filtering airborne sound**, offering versatile solutions for various acoustic applications.

### Why Does It Matter?

By integrating **innovative material design** with **advanced acoustic control strategies**, we aim to:  

✔️ **Noise Reduction** – Mitigating unwanted sound from **aircraft engines, automobiles, and impact-induced noise** in **urban and residential areas**.  
✔️ **Advanced Sound Manipulation** – Enabling novel effects such as **acoustic cloaking and beam shaping** for **secure communications and privacy applications**.  

Our goal is to develop **smart, tunable metasurfaces** that dynamically adapt to environmental conditions, delivering **superior performance** compared to conventional noise-control methods.
