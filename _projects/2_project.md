### What’s This About?  

Materials with **multiple stable states** exhibit intriguing dynamic behaviors such as **phase transitions, dislocation propagation, and transition waves**. While these effects have been well-studied in **ferroelectrics, ferromagnets, and shape memory alloys**, recent advancements in **mechanical metamaterials** have enabled the development of **macroscopic** multistable systems with unprecedented **tunability**. By **precisely engineering energy landscapes**, we can achieve **controlled phase transitions**, enabling the design of **adaptive, deployable, and load-bearing structures** with tailored mechanical properties.

### Why Does It Matter? 

Multistable lattices provide **exceptional tunability**, making them ideal for **reconfigurable systems** that dynamically respond to external stimuli. This capability is critical for:  

- **Soft Robotics** – Enabling flexible, shape-changing actuators with programmable motion.  
- **Energy Absorption** – Developing impact-resistant materials that efficiently dissipate energy.  
- **Deployable & Load-Bearing Structures** – Creating **mechanically robust yet adaptable architectures** for **aerospace, civil engineering, and infrastructure applications**.  
- **Sound & Vibration Control** – Engineering materials that manipulate **wave propagation** through stable and transitional states.  

By advancing our understanding of **multistable lattices**, we aim to develop **next-generation adaptive materials** that dynamically adjust to their environment while maintaining structural integrity.
