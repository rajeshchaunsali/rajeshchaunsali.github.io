We are looking for passionate and dynamic people to build a vibrant team. If you are interested in our research, you may find below opportunities at several levels:

---

##### Postdoctoral Research
Candidates interested in pursuing theoretical, numerical, or experimental research in our group are encouraged to email us and include your CV, a list of two references, and a one-page research proposal. The applications of strong candidates may be considered for the [Raman Post-Doctoral Fellowship](https://iisc.ac.in/post-docs/){:target="\_blank"} or the [Institute of Eminence (IoE) Post-Doctoral Fellowship](https://iisc.ac.in/post-docs/){:target="\_blank"}. Candidates can also look for external funding schemes, such as [National Post-Doctoral Fellowship](https://serbonline.in/SERB/npdf?HomePage=New) and [Dr. S. Radhakrishnan Post-Doctoral Fellowship](https://frg.ugc.ac.in/Home). 

*We may have an industry-sponsored post-doctoral position in the coming months. Candidates with expertise in fiber optics or optical metamaterials are encouraged to apply.*

---

##### Graduate Research
Candidates who have been offered admission to Ph.D./M.Tech. programs at IISc are welcome to email us their CVs and discuss research opportunities in the group.

*We are not accepting any research students for the current academic cycle (2022-2023).*

---

##### Undergraduate Research
Candidates currently pursuing an undergraduate degree in engineering, physics, or applied mathematics are encouraged to apply through the fellowship programs of [JNCASR](https://www.jncasr.ac.in/academic/fandeprogrammes/srfp/){:target="\_blank"} and/or [Science Academies](https://www.ias.ac.in/){:target="\_blank"}.

*Students passionate about experimental mechanics are encouraged to email me directly, along with a strong justification for their skills.*

---

##### Project Assistants/Associates
We have an opening for a Project Assistant/Associate for a project on Topological Metamaterials. Candidates with demonstrated skills in experimental mechanics are encouraged to email us their CVs. The salary would be as per IISc norms. 

*I often get several emails for these positions. If I did not respond, please know that I looked at your application carefully but determined that your background was not an ideal fit for the advertised position.*
