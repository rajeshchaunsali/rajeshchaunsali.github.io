The Laboratory for Engineered Materials & Structures (LEMS) in the [Department of Aerospace Engineering](https://aero.iisc.ac.in/) at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) specializes in designing advanced materials and structures with unconventional mechanical responses. Our research leverages **geometry**, **symmetry**, and **structural interactions** to tailor material behavior under dynamic loading conditions, such as vibrations and wave propagation. By employing a **physics-based**, **bottom-up** approach, we develop nontrivial building blocks that surpass the capabilities of traditional materials. Integrating theoretical modeling, numerical simulations, and experimental validation, we advance the fundamental understanding of engineered systems and innovate solutions for aerospace, mechanical, and related engineering applications.
