I am an Assistant Professor of [Aerospace Engineering](http://aero.iisc.ac.in/) at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc). My research lies at the intersection of physics and engineering, where I am broadly interested in understanding and controlling the propagation
of mechanical energy in engineered materials such as metamaterials. Please find my full CV [here](assets/pdf/CV.pdf).
