abstract = {Previous studies of the first author and others have focused on low audible frequency (<1 kHz) shear and surface wave motion in and on a viscoelastic material comprised of or representative of soft biological tissue. A specific case considered has been surface (Rayleigh) wave motion caused by a circular disk located on the surface and oscillating normal to it. Different approaches to identifying the type and coefficients of a viscoelastic model of the material based on these measurements have been proposed. One approach has been to optimize coefficients in an assumed viscoelastic model type to match measurements of the frequency-dependent Rayleigh wave speed. Another approach has been to optimize coefficients in an assumed viscoelastic model type to match the complex-valued frequency response function (FRF) between the excitation location and points at known radial distances from it. In the present article, the relative merits of these approaches are explored theoretically, computationally, and experimentally. It is concluded that matching the complex-valued FRF may provide a better estimate of the viscoelastic model type and parameter values; though, as the studies herein show, there are inherent limitations to identifying viscoelastic properties based on surface wave measurements.}

  abstract = {We study wave propagation in strongly nonlinear one-dimensional diatomic granular crystals under an impact load. Depending on the mass ratio of the “light” to “heavy” beads, this system exhibits rich wave dynamics from highly localized traveling waves to highly dispersive waves featuring strong attenuation. We demonstrate experimentally the nonlinear resonant and antiresonant interactions of particles, and we verify that the nonlinear resonance results in strong wave attenuation, leading to highly efficient nonlinear energy cascading without relying on material damping. In this process, mechanical energy is transferred from low to high frequencies, while propagating waves emerge in both ordered and chaotic waveforms via a distinctive spatial cascading. This energy transfer mechanism from lower to higher frequencies and wave numbers is of particular significance toward the design of novel nonlinear acoustic metamaterials with inherently passive energy redistribution properties.}

	Abstract = {We present an active, purely mechanical stress wave isolator that consists of short cylindrical particles arranged in a helical architecture. This phononic structure allows us to change inter-particle stiffness dynamically by controlling the contact angles of the cylinders. We use torsional travelling waves to control the contact angles, thereby imposing a desired spatio-temporal stiffness variation to the phononic crystal along the longitudinal direction. Such torsional excitation is a form of parametric pumping in the system, which results in the breakage of the time-reversal symmetry. We report that, in quasi-static sense, the system shows topologically non-trivial band-gaps. However, in a dynamic regime where the pumping effect is significant, these band-gaps become asymmetric with respect to the frequency and wavenumber domains in the dispersion relationship. By using numerical simulations, we show that such asymmetry has a direct correspondence to the topological invariant, i.e., Chern number, of the system. We propose that this asymmetry, accompanied by selective inter-band transition, can be utilized for directional isolation of the stress wave propagating along the phononic crystal.},

In particular, we introduce both discrete and continuous spectral transformation schemes to generate a family of granular chains that are isospectral in their linear limit. Inspired by the principle of supersymmetry in quantum systems, we also introduce a methodology to add or remove certain eigenfrequencies, and we demonstrate numerically that the corresponding physical system can be constructed in the setting of one-dimensional granular crystals. In the linear regime, we highlight the similarities in the elastic wave transmission characteristics of such isospectral systems, and emphasize that the presented mathematical framework allows one to suitably tailor the wave transmission through a general class of granular chains, both ordered and disordered. Moreover, we show how the dynamic response of these structures deviates from its linear limit as we introduce Hertzian nonlinearity in the chain and how nonlinearity breaks the notion of linear isospectrality.}

abstract = {We present a novel device that can offer two extremes of elastic wave propagation — nearly complete transmission and strong attenuation under impulse excitation. The mechanism of this highly tunable device relies on intermixing effects of dispersion and nonlinearity. The device consists of identical cylinders arranged in a chain, which interact with each other as per nonlinear Hertz contact law. For a ‘dimer’ configuration, i.e., two different contact angles alternating in the chain, we analytically, numerically, and experimentally show that impulse excitation can either propagate as a localized wave, or it can travel as a highly dispersive wave. Remarkably, these extremes can be achieved in this periodic arrangement simply by in-situ control of contact angles between cylinders. We close the discussion by highlighting the key characteristics of the mechanisms that facilitate strong attenuation of incident impulse. These include low-to-high frequency scattering, and turbulence-like cascading in a periodic system. We thus envision that these adaptive, cylinder-based nonlinear phononic crystals, in conjunction with conventional impact mitigation mechanisms, could be used to design highly tunable and efficient impact manipulation devices.}

	Abstract = {Recently, there have been significant efforts to guide mechanical energy in structures by relying on a novel topological framework popularized by the discovery of topological insulators. Here, we propose a topological metamaterial system based on the design of the Stewart Platform, which can not only guide mechanical waves robustly in a desired path, but also can be tuned in situ to change this wave path at will. Without resorting to any active materials, the current system harnesses bistablilty in its unit cells, such that tuning can be performed simply by a dial-in action. Consequently, a topological transition mechanism inspired by the quantum valley Hall effect can be achieved. We show the possibility of tuning in a variety of topological and traditional waveguides in the same system, and numerically investigate key qualitative and quantitative differences between them. We observe that even though both types of waveguides can lead to significant wave transmission for a certain frequency range, topological waveguides are distinctive as they support robust, back scattering immune, one-way wave propagation.},

This particular design allows us to move the double Dirac cone to a lower frequency than the resonating frequency of local resonators. We then manipulate the pattern of local resonators to open subwavelength Bragg band gaps that are topologically distinct. Building on this method, we verify numerically that a waveguide at an interface between two topologically distinct resonating plate structures can be used for guiding low-frequency, spin-dependent one-way flexural waves along a desired path with bends.},

The direct velocity measurements using laser Doppler vibrometry agree well with the numerical simulation results.

We show that this continuum system eliminates unwanted in-plane plate modes and allows the manipulation of low-frequency flexural modes by exploiting the local resonance of the bolts. We report the existence of a pair of double Dirac cones near the resonant frequency of the bolts, one of which leads to the creation of a topological complete bandgap that forbids all the plate modes.

From topological insulators to topological superconductors and Weyl semimetals, it is now understood that some of the most remarkable and robust phases in electronic systems (e.g., quantum Hall or anomalous quantum Hall) are the result of topological protection. These powerful ideas have recently begun to be explored also in bosonic systems. Topologically protected acoustic, mechanical, and optical edge states have been demonstrated in a number of systems that recreate the requisite topological conditions. Such states that propagate without backscattering could find important applications in communications and energy technologies. Here, a topologically bound mechanical state, a different class of nonpropagating protected state that cannot be destroyed by local perturbations, is demonstrated. It is in particular a mechanical analogue of the well-known Majorana bound states (MBSs) of electronic topological superconductor systems. The topological binding is implemented by creating a Kekulé distortion vortex on a 2D mechanical honeycomb superlattice that can be mapped to a magnetic flux vortex in a topological superconductor.},

This framework has been limited to linear lattice dynamics so far. Here we show a topological transition in a nonlinear regime and its implication in emerging nonlinear solutions. We employ nonlinearity management such that the system consists of masses connected with two types of nonlinear springs, “stiffening” and “softening” types, alternating along the length. We show, analytically and numerically, that the lattice makes a topological transition simply by changing the excitation amplitude and invoking nonlinear dynamics. Consequently, we witness the emergence of a family of finite-frequency edge modes, not observed in linear phononic systems. We also report the existence of kink solitons at the topological transition point. These correspond to heteroclinic orbits that form a closed curve in the phase portrait separating the two topologically distinct regimes. These findings suggest that nonlinearity can be used as a strategic tuning knob to alter topological characteristics of phononic crystals. These also provide fresh perspectives towards understanding a different family of nonlinear solutions in light of topology.}

We consider a chain inspired from the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model but with a finite-frequency edge state and the dynamics governed by second-order differential equations. We introduce a cubic onsite nonlinearity and study this nonlinear effect on the edge state's frequency and linear stability. Nonlinear continuation reveals that the edge state loses its typical shape enforced by the chiral symmetry and becomes generally unstable due to various types of instabilities that we analyze using a combination of spectral stability and Krein signature analysis. This results in an initially excited nonlinear-edge state shedding its energy into the bulk over a long time. However, the stability trends differ both qualitatively and quantitatively when softening and stiffening types of nonlinearity are considered. In the latter, we find a frequency regime where nonlinear edge states can be linearly stable. This enables high-amplitude edge states to remain spatially localized without shedding their energy, a feature that we have confirmed via long-time dynamical simulations. Finally, we examine the robustness of frequency and stability of nonlinear edge states against disorder, and find that those are more robust under a chiral disorder compared to a nonchiral disorder. Moreover, the frequency-regime where high-amplitude edge states were found to be linearly stable remains intact in the presence of a small amount of disorder of both types.}

Here, we numerically and experimentally study corner states in a two-dimensional phononic crystal, namely a continuous elastic plate with embedded bolts in a hexagonal pattern. We create interfacial corners by adjoining trivial and non-trivial topological configurations. Due to the rich interaction between the bolts and the continuous elastic plate, we find a variety of corner states of and devoid of topological origin. Strikingly, some of the corner states are not only highly-localized but also tunable. Taking advantage of this property, we experimentally demonstrate asymmetric corner localization in a Z-shaped domain wall. This finding could create interest in exploration of tunable corner states for the use of advanced control of wave localization.},

  Abstract = {We consider a mechanical lattice inspired by the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model along with cubic Klein-Gordon–type nonlinearity. We investigate the long-time dynamics of the nonlinear edge states, which are obtained by nonlinear continuation of topological edge states of the linearized model. Linearly unstable edge states delocalize and lead to chaos and thermalization of the lattice. Linearly stable edge states also reach the same fate, but after a critical strength of perturbation is added to the initial edge state. We show that the thermalized lattice in all these cases shows an effective renormalization of the dispersion relation. Intriguingly, this renormalized dispersion relation displays a unique symmetry, i.e., its square is symmetric about a finite squared frequency, akin to the chiral symmetry of the linearized model.}

  Abstract = {A remarkable feature of the trimer Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH3) model is that it supports localized edge states. However, in contrast to the dimer version of the model, a change in the total number of edge states in SSH3 without mirror-symmetry is not necessarily associated with a phase transition, i.e., a closing of the band gap. As such, the topological invariant predicted by the 10-fold way classification does not always coincide with the total number of edge states present. Moreover, although Zak's phase remains quantized for the case of a mirror-symmetric chain, it is known that it fails to take integer values in the absence of this symmetry and thus it cannot play the role of a well-defined bulk invariant in the general case. Attempts to establish a bulk-edge correspondence have been made via Green's functions or through extensions to a synthetic dimension. Here we propose a simple alternative for SSH3, utilizing the previously introduced sublattice Zak's phase, which also remains valid in the absence of mirror symmetry and for noncommensurate chains. The defined bulk quantity takes integer values, is gauge invariant, and can be interpreted as the difference of the number of edge states between a reference and a target Hamiltonian. Our derivation further predicts the exact corrections for finite open chains, is straightforwardly generalizable, and invokes a chiral-like symmetry present in this model.}

	abstract = {Topological mechanical metamaterials have been widely explored for their boundary states, which can be robustly isolated or transported in a controlled manner. However, such systems often require pre-configured design or complex active actuation for wave manipulation. Here, we present the possibility of in-situ transfer of topological boundary modes by leveraging the reconfigurability intrinsic in twisted origami lattices. In particular, we employ a dimer Kresling origami system consisting of unit cells with opposite chirality, which couples longitudinal and rotational degrees of freedom in elastic waves. The quasi-static twist imposed on the lattice alters the strain landscape of the lattice, thus significantly affecting the wave dispersion relations and the topology of the underlying bands. This in turn facilitates an efficient topological state transfer from one edge to the other. This simple and practical approach to energy transfer in origami-inspired lattices can thus inspire a new class of efficient energy manipulation devices.},

We first propose a quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulator based on an out-of-plane spring-mass model and analytically study the interplay between the disorder and topology in both topologically trivial and nontrivial systems. We adopt the spin Bott index to characterize the topological property in disordered mechanical systems. By tracking the evolution of the spin Bott index with the increase of disorders, we quantitatively demonstrate the disorder induced transition from a topologically nontrivial QSH insulator to a trivial insulator. We then validate the topological phase transition through transient analysis in discrete lattices. Finally, we design a phononic crystal based on the discrete spring-mass model and numerically verify the topologically protected states along the boundary between the trivial insulator and disordered topological QSH insulator in a continuous system. This work puts a step forward in understanding the role of disorder in a 2D topological classical system.},

	abstract = {Topological physics has revolutionized materials science, introducing topological phases of matter in diverse settings ranging from quantum to photonic and phononic systems. Herein, we present a family of topological systems, which we term ``strain topological metamaterials'', whose topological properties are hidden and unveiled only under higher-order (strain) coordinate transformations. We firstly show that the canonical mass dimer, a model that can describe various settings such as electrical circuits and optics, among others, belongs to this family where strain coordinates reveal a topological nontriviality for the edge states at free boundaries. Subsequently, we introduce a mechanical analog of the Majorana-supporting Kitaev chain, which supports topological edge states for both fixed and free boundaries within the proposed framework. Thus, our findings not only extend the way topological edge states are identified, but also promote the fabrication of novel topological metamaterials in various fields, with more complex, tailored boundaries.},

We use a weakly nonlinear formal reduction within the lattice band gap to obtain a continuum, nonlinear Dirac-type system. We derive the Dirac soliton profiles and the model's conservation laws analytically. We then examine the cases of the semi-infinite and the finite domains and illustrate how the soliton solutions of the bulk problem can be glued to the boundaries for different types of boundary conditions. We thus explain the existence of various kinds of nonlinear edge states in the system, of which only one leads to the standard topological edge states observed in the linear limit. We finally examine the stability of bulk and edge states and verify them through direct numerical simulations, in which we observe a solitonlike wave setting into motion due to the instability.},

and stability of high-amplitude corner states, which can find applications in optics, acoustics, elastodynamics,

springs, known to exhibit edge and corner states in its linear regime. By introducing on-site cubic nonlinearity,
we analyze its impact on both edge and corner states. The nonlinear continuation of the corner state unveils stable
high-amplitude corner states within the lattice, featuring nonzero displacements at even sites from the corner—a
characteristic absent in the linear limit. Interestingly, the nonlinear continuation of the edge state reveals its
transformation into distinct families of high-amplitude corner states via two pitchfork bifurcations. While some
states maintain stability, others become unstable through real instability and Neimark-Sacker bifurcation. These
unstable corner states dissipate their energy into the edges and the bulk over an extended period, as corroborated
by long-time dynamical simulations. Consequently, our study provides insights into achieving significant energy
localization at the corners of HOTIs through various classes of nonlinear states.},

  abstract = {We present a magnetoelastic lattice in which a localized external magnetic field, generated by an assembly of fixed magnets, tunes the potential landscape to create monostable, bistable, and tristable configurations. Focusing on the tristable potential, we numerically and experimentally confirm the existence of three distinct types of transition waves, each characterized by unique amplitudes and velocities, and establish a scaling law that governs their behavior. We also examine how these transition waves interact with the system's finite boundaries. Furthermore, by adjusting the potential symmetry through the localized external field, we investigate wave collision dynamics. In lattices with asymmetric potentials, the collision of similar transition waves leads to the remote nucleation of a third phase. In symmetric potentials, the collision of dissimilar transition waves results in the formation of a stationary domain wall, with its width tuned by the shape of the tristable potential well.},

This work introduces a prototypical spring-mass model that extends beyond established canonical models, revealing topological edge states with distinct profiles at opposite edges. These edge states originate from hidden symmetries that become apparent only in deformation coordinates, as opposed to the conventional displacement coordinates used for bulk-boundary correspondence. Our model, realized through the intricate connectivity of a spinner chain, demonstrates experimentally distinct edge states at opposite ends. By extending this framework to two dimensions, we explore the conditions required for such edge waves and their hidden symmetry in deformation coordinates. We also show that these edge states are robust against disorders that respect the hidden symmetry.
